Here’s a standard **English proof of Taylor’s theorem (with Lagrange remainder)**. I’ll keep it clean and rigorous.

## Taylor’s Theorem (Lagrange form)

Let (f) be (n+1) times differentiable on an interval containing (a) and (x). Then there exists (\xi) between (a) and (x) such that
[
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k+\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
]
The last term is the **remainder** (R_{n}(x)).

## Proof

Fix (a) and (x\neq a). Define the Taylor polynomial of degree (n) at (a):
[
T_n(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(t-a)^k.
]
Let
[
\phi(t)=f(t)-T_n(t),
]
so (\phi) is (n+1) times differentiable and satisfies
[
\phi^{(k)}(a)=0 \quad \text{for } k=0,1,\dots,n.
]
(Reason: (T_n) matches the first (n) derivatives of (f) at (a).)

Now introduce the auxiliary function
[
F(t)=\phi(t)-\phi(x),\frac{(t-a)^{n+1}}{(x-a)^{n+1}}.
]
Observe:

1. (F(a)=\phi(a)-\phi(x)\cdot 0=0).
2. (F(x)=\phi(x)-\phi(x)\cdot 1=0).

So (F(a)=F(x)=0). By **Rolle’s theorem**, there exists (c_1) between (a) and (x) such that
[
F'(c_1)=0.
]

Next, note that for (k=0,1,\dots,n), we also have (F^{(k)}(a)=0). Indeed:

* (\phi^{(k)}(a)=0) for (k\le n),
* and ((t-a)^{n+1}) has its first (n) derivatives equal to (0) at (t=a).

Hence (F'(a)=0) as well. Apply Rolle’s theorem again to (F') on ([a,c_1]) (or between (a) and (c_1)): there exists (c_2) between (a) and (c_1) such that
[
F''(c_2)=0.
]

Continuing this process, after (n+1) applications, we obtain some (\xi) between (a) and (x) such that
[
F^{(n+1)}(\xi)=0.
]

Now compute (F^{(n+1)}(t)). Since (T_n) has degree (n), (T_n^{(n+1)}(t)=0), so
[
\phi^{(n+1)}(t)=f^{(n+1)}(t).
]
Also,
[
\frac{d^{,n+1}}{dt^{n+1}}(t-a)^{n+1}=(n+1)!.
]
Therefore,
[
F^{(n+1)}(t)=\phi^{(n+1)}(t)-\phi(x)\frac{(n+1)!}{(x-a)^{n+1}}
= f^{(n+1)}(t)-\phi(x)\frac{(n+1)!}{(x-a)^{n+1}}.
]
Plug (t=\xi) and use (F^{(n+1)}(\xi)=0):
[
0=f^{(n+1)}(\xi)-\phi(x)\frac{(n+1)!}{(x-a)^{n+1}}.
]
So
[
\phi(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
]
But (\phi(x)=f(x)-T_n(x)). Hence
[
f(x)=T_n(x)+\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1},
]
which is exactly Taylor’s theorem with the Lagrange remainder. ∎

If you want, I can also provide:

* the **integral remainder** form (often cleaner for analysis),
* or a version assuming only (f^{(n)}) absolutely continuous.
